<h1>virtualisation </h1>
<br/>

In computing, <b>  virtualization </b> refers to the act of creating 
 a virtual (rather than actual) version of something,<br/>
 this includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.

 <li > <h1>Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) level </h1></li>
			Every machine has an instruction set . This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware.
			Using this instructions software can communicate with hardware.
<li> <h1> Virtualization at Operating System(O.S.) level</h1></li>
          	 	          In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc.
 </ol>
 	<ul type="cercle">
 	     <li>cloud sometimes we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, If we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer(HAL) level this can take too much time.
 	     </li> 	
 	     <li>So to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware.
